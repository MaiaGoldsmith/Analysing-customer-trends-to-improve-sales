### Analysis - After completing an exploratory data analysis I applied the following techniques

- Regression analysis using an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) test. using Python, to see if there was a relationship between customer loyalty points and other customer metrics.
- K-means clustering along with Elbow and Silhouette methods, using Python,to identify groups for market segmentation.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using Python, to analyse the product reviews.
- Statistical analysis techniques performed using R, to assess data reliability and correlation of sales data in different regions.
- Linear and multi linear regression models built using R, to see if sales values in one region could reliably predict sales in other regions given the strong correlations.
